 * What every command declares about itself, and the table that routes them.

 *
 * 1. **The table cannot be partial.** It is a mapped type over the command kind
 *    union, so omitting a kind does not compile and adding an unrouted one does
 *    not compile. The same mechanism that already makes the IPC `Handlers`
 *    exhaustive.
 * 2. **Neither axis can be left undeclared**, and neither can be declared
 *    without naming its consequence — see {@link Invertibility} and
 *    {@link Reproducibility}.
 *
 * §3a is explicit that the reproducibility axis exists **before any command
 * does**, because retrofitting it rewrites the log rather than extending it.
 * That is why this file lands ahead of anything that can execute.

 * Which component is permitted to write this command's effect (rule B3).
 *
 * One writer per concern. Two writers is how a codebase acquires sidecar hacks,
 * and for a document it is how one engine's idea of the page tree overwrites
 * another's.
 *
 * Derived from the seam rather than listed, so the set of writers has one
 * declaration. A writer added to `WriterSession` without an adapter is a
 * compile error at every spec that names it, which is the direction that fails
 * safe.

 * comment. A plain `{ writer: WriterOfRecord; apply: ... }` cannot express that
 * — the two fields would be independent, and a spec could declare `mupdf` and
 * supply an `apply` taking a PDFium session.
 *
 * A distributed mapped type collapsed to its own union is what binds them: for
 * each writer there is exactly one member, carrying that writer's literal type
 * and the `Apply` derived from it. Choosing the `writer` therefore chooses the
 * `apply` signature, including which **shape** it has — a byte-image writer's
 * `apply` returns bytes, a live-session writer's returns void (§8).

 * non-invertible command without a checkpoint is unrepresentable. Declaring
 * `invertible: false` without acknowledging that it forces a checkpoint is how
 * checkpoints quietly become optional.
 *
 * `deletePages` is the shape that makes this real: restoring a deleted page
 * needs its objects, which cannot ride in a serialisable inverse, so it falls
 * to `checkpoint` — while §4 reserves checkpoints for redaction, flatten,
 * encryption and OCR precisely because they are the exception.

 * OCR output moves with the engine version; AI is nondeterministic by design;
 * anything minting random PDF object identifiers cannot reproduce itself.
 *
 * A command that is not reproducible **records its effect rather than its
 * intent**, and replay re-applies the stored effect instead of re-running the
 * operation. That sentence is the type: `reproducible: false` cannot be written
 * without `replay: 'stored-effect'`, so the consequence travels with the

 * bus captures prior state before `apply`, never a handler — and leaves the
 * *type* to the log, because a capture's return shape is the inverse's shape
